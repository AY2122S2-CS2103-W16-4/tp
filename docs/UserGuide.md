## Features

Notes about the command format:

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [pr/PROPERTY]` can be used as `n/John Doe pr/north,123 Street,1-room,$300000` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[p/PHONE_NUMBER]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `p/12345`, `p/12345 p/54321` etc.

- Inputting information after `pr/` & `t/` indicates the type of property a user is selling or buying.<br>
e.g. `pr/PROPERTY, t/USER_TYPE` can be used as `pr/East, Block 123, 2-room, $550000, t/seller` means this person is a seller looking to sell a 2-room property at Block 123 which is located in the East, with a price of $550000.<br>More information about the required format of properties can be found in the next section.

- Person parameters can be in any order.<br>
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER pr/PROPERTY`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER pr/PROPERTY n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

Notes about the property format:
- Properties must be specified in the following format: `pr/REGION,ADDRESS,SIZE,PRICE`. Whitespace between parameters is ignored.<br>
  e.g. Both `pr/East,Pasir Ris Drive 1 Block 123,2-room,$550000` and `pr/East, Pasir Ris Drive 1 Block 123, 2-room, $550000` are acceptable. `pr/Pasir Ris Drive 1 Block 123, East, 2-room, $550000` is not acceptable.

Parameter formats:
- REGION: One of [`North`, `South`, `East`, `West`, `Central`] (Non case-sensitive).
- ADDRESS: Any non-empty string that does not contain `,`. e.g. `Pasir Ris Drive 1 Block 123`
- SIZE: One of [`1-room`,`2-room`, `3-room`, `4-room`, `5-room`] (Non case-sensitive).
