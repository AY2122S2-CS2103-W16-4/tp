## Features

Notes about the command format:

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
- Inputting information after `pr/` & `t/` indicates the type of property a user is selling or buying.
e.g. `pr/PROPERTY_REGION, PROPERTY_ADDRESS, PROPERTY_SIZE, PROPERTY_PRICE, t/userType` can be used as `pr/East, Block 123, 2-room, $550000, t/seller` means this user is a seller looking to sell a 2-room property at Block 123 which is located in the East, with a price of $550000.
- Parameters can be in any order.
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
- If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you
specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter
will be taken.
e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
