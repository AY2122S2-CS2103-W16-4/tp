# Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## Favourite feature and Favourites window

### Proposed Implementation

The proposed `favourite` mechanism will make use of a new attribute called `Favourite` under a `Person`. How we went about creating this mechanism is by going through the list of Persons and checking if their `Favourite` instance returns "ðŸŒŸ" (represents favourited) when `toString()` is called.

Given below is an example of how the `favourite` mechanism behaves with the Favourites window.

Step 1. The user starts the application with pre-loaded data of Persons.

Step 2. Assuming there is a Person with the number 1. User then executes `favourite 1` command to favourite the first Person in the application. The system will create a new Person with the `Favourite` instance's value set as true. Then calls `Model#setPerson()` to set Person 1 to be a favourited Person.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Every newly added Person will have the default value of `False` for `Favourite` attribute, thus will never appear in the Favourites window before the `favourite` command is called on them.

</aside>

Step 3. User can access the Favourites window by navigating to the menu item as shown in the diagram, which pops up a new window that contains only those Persons that have â€˜Favouriteâ€™ instance's value set as True or can input the command `fw` to open up the Favourites window through this CLI command.

## Match feature/Window
The `match` opens a new `MatchWindow`, in which all matches are displayed in pairs.
The left column shows the sellers, while the right column shows the buyers.

Two `Person` make a match if the seller has at least one `property` that matches the buyer's `preference`.

## Help Feature and Window
The `help` command and selecting help from the dropdown opens the `helpwindow`.

The contents of `helpPanePlaceHolder` is then replaced according to which tab
that the user has selected to view more details about a specific feature or general features
of Realestatepro

## Property
The `Property` is a new attribute that can be added to a `Person` that represents a real estate property listing. A `Person` is able to hold multiple properties including none.

The `Property` itself consists of the following attributes: `Region`, `Address`, `Size`, `Price`.

- `Region` represents the general location of the `Address` of the `Property`. It is an enum that can be one of the following: `NORTH`, `SOUTH`, `EAST`, `WEST`, `CENTRAL`.

- `Address` represents the exact location of the `Property`.

- `Size` represents the size of the `Property` in terms of the number of rooms it has. It is an enum that can be one of the following: `ONE_ROOM`, `TWO_ROOM`, `THREE_ROOM`, `FOUR_ROOM`, `FIVE_ROOM`.

- `Price` represents the price of the `Property`. It's `toString()` method returns the price in the form of `$###` or `$###.#K` or `$###.#M` depending on the value of the `Price` for easier readability.

## Preference
The `Preference` is a new attribute that can be added to a `Person`. A `Person` can either have a `Preference` or not.

A `Preference` contains the following attributes: `Region`, `Size`, `lowPrice`, `highPrice`,
among which the first two is explained in the previous sector.
The latter two specifies the expected range of money the buyer would like to pay.

## UserType
The `UserType` represents an attribute that is added to a `Person` & represents the `Person` as a `buyer` or `seller`. A `Person` is only either a `buyer` or `seller` at a given time. They cannot be both or none. The `UserType` of a `Person` is derived from the presence of a `Property` or `Preference`. If the `Person` has a `Property`, then they are a `seller`, but if the person has a `Preference`, then they are a `buyer`.

Unlike other attributes of a `Person`, the `UserType` of a `Person` cannot be edited _directly_ via the `edit` command. A `Person` can be changed from a `buyer` to a `seller` & vice versa if the person's property or preference is changed. This can be done with the command: `edit INDEX pr/PROPERTY_DETAILS` or `edit INDEX pf/PREFERENCE_DETAILS`. This means editing a `Person` to have a `Property` instead of a `Preference` will change them from a `buyer` (had a `Preference` initially) to a `seller` (now has a `Property`). In other cases where other attributes of a `Person` are being edited, e.g. phone number, address, the `UserType` of that `Person` being edited will remain the same.

## Remind feature
The remind feature is implemented by storing a static list of Persons the user wants to be reminded of.

- `ReminderTask` -- Schedules and handles the work of activating the Reminders window.
- `ReminderPersons` -- Stores a `HashSet` of `Person`s, because only 1 reminder can be set per person & thus only 1 occurrence of a Person in this data structure is allowed.
- `ReminderWindow` --  A Window to display all `Person`s the client set reminders for.
- Both `ReminderTask` and `ReminderWindow` classes are singletons as there can only ever be 1 occurrence of these classes.

The remind feature can be activated by typing `remind INDEX r/ReminderDetails` where `INDEX` is the `Person` the user wants to set a reminder for and `ReminderDetails` are the details of the reminder in regard to the specific client.

Given below is an example usage scenarios and the behavior of the program specific to this feature.

Step 1: The user launches the app. Within 5 seconds, a Reminder window pops up & displays any reminders the user has actively set. As the User does not have any active reminders set, they can add a reminder.

Step 2: User executes the `remind` command by typing in `remind 1 r/arrange meeting`, as the user wants to set a reminder for the client with `Index` 1. The `RemindCommandParser` parses the `Index` the `User` inputted & creates a `RemindCommand`. The `RemindCommand` is executed & retrieves the `Person` corresponding to the `Index` from `Model`. This `Person` and the corresponding `Reminder` is then added to the HashMap in `ReminderPersons`. The `CommandResult` returned is created with the input argument `showReminders` marked as true. This then gets executed by MainWindow and the `ReminderWindow` is launched.

Step 3: The User will be prompted with the Reminder window, containing the client the user just set a `Reminder` for.

Step 4: The User uses the app for their normal use, after 1 minute of the Reminder window popping up, the Reminder window launches again to actively remind the User of any reminders.


## [Proposed] Upload Image
The upload image feature is implemented by storing a set of `UserImage` containing
a `FilePath` to an image file and optional `description` of the image. A `LinkedHashSet` in order
to retain order based on the order of insertion.

- `UserImage` -- Contains all information needed to display the image that has been associated with the person
- `FilePath` -- Leads to a file that is located in the user's system

There are two commands that are associated with the feature which are namely `upload` and `viewimage`.

Below is an example usage scenerio and the behaviour of the program:

Step 1: User calls the `upload` command.
`UploadCommandParser` would then be used to parse the command inputted to obtain the `index` of the `Person` to add
the image with, the `filepath` to the file which is checked whether it is an existing file and
the `description` if provided.

Step 2: A `UserImage` is created from the parameters obtained from `UploadCommandParser` that checks to ensure that the
file `FilePath` leads to is an image before adding it to the
`Person`.

Step 3: User calls the `viewimage` command that `ViewImageCommandParser` parsers to get the `index` of the `Person` to
view the all the `UserImage` in the `Person`.

Step 4: The set of `UserImage` is then passed to `model` via `model#updateViewPerson(Set<UserImage>)`.
The `viewImageWindow` is the displayed after it retrieves the set from `model`

Step 5: The set of `UserImage` is then converted into a `ArrayList` and the first image is displayed in the window.

## Statistics feature/Window
The `stats` opens a new `StatisticsWindow` that displays a pie chart with the information of the number of sellers & buyers in the 5 different regions namely {North, South, East, West, Central}.

This allows the user to be visualize his/her client's data to make better business decisions.

## [Proposed] Sorting

The sorting feature allows the user to sort the list of `Person` displayed.

The following table shows the attributes that the list can be sorted by and their corresponding keywords.

| Attribute            | Keyword        |
|----------------------|----------------|
| `Name`               | `name`         |
| `Phone`              | `phone`        |
| `Email`              | `email`        |
| `Favourite`          | `favourite`    |
| `Address`            | `address`      |
| `UserType`           | `usertype`     |
| Number of `Property` | `num_property` |

Sorting the list is done by using the `sort` command, which has the following syntax: `sort [KEYWORD]...`.

If multiple attributes are specified, the first attribute is given the highest priority, while the last attribute is given the lowest priority. For example, `sort address name` will sort the list by `Address` first, followed by `Name` if `Address` is equal.

The sorting feature is implemented by using a `SortedList<Person>` to observe the `FilteredList<Person>` in `ModelManager`.

Whenever the underlying application data is modified, the `FilteredList<Person>` is notified first and will filter the data. If there is any change in the `FilteredList<Person>`, the `SortedList<Person>` is notified and will sort the filtered data.

## Feature `find` enhanced
In addition to the original `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, more predicates concerning each of the attributes in a `Person` are created.
They can be fed to the `FindCommand` to filter out `Person` with the specified keywords in the specified attribute.
